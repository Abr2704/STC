      <h1>Level 4 &amp; 5 – University Level Computing (Cyber Security Pathway)</h1>
      <p>
        Our Level 4 and Level 5 programmes in Computing provide a university-level pathway,
        equivalent to the first two years of a UK Bachelor’s degree in a computing discipline.
        The Cyber Security pathway develops technical and professional skills for roles in
        cyber defence, security operations and related fields.
      </p>
      <p class="fee">
        Typical tuition fee: €1,400 for Level 4 and €1,400 for Level 5.
